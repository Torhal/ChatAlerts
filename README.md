# ChatAlerts
ChatAlerts allows you to select which docked ChatFrames will alert you when they have new activity.

ChatFrame tabs can have specific message-type filters set on them from the default UI. ChatAlerts gives you the option to listen for certain message types - when these message types are triggered, the appropriate tab will begin flashing to alert you to new activity.

## Features

- The alert flash can be disabled, in favor of using a different font color for the tab name.
- Color picker for the alert flash texture.
- Mouseover highlighting can be toggled.
